# Privacy Hub - Capstone Spring 2021 Project
Privacy Hub is a Windows app that lets you track which of your computer's processes are currently using your USB peripherals, such as a webcam or a microphone. You can specify what USB devices to keep track of. You can also set trusted processes so you are not notified of their device usage.

## Monitoring With the Devices & Processes Screens
Privacy Hub has two main views.
1. The devices screen, which displays processes grouped by the devices that they are using:

2. The processes screen, which reverses the grouping:

Both of these screens let you monitor what processes are using your selected devices. If a process is accessing your device in any way, it will display on these screens. This does not mean the processes are actively using them -- it simply means that they currently have access to them. 

### Refreshing
The screens automatically refresh every so often, but you can manually refresh them with the "Refresh" button, if you desire.
