# Privacy Hub - Capstone Spring 2021 Project
Privacy Hub is a Windows app that lets you track which of your computer's processes are currently using your USB peripherals, such as a webcam or a microphone. You can specify what USB devices to keep track of. You can also set trusted processes so you are not notified of their device usage.

***Right now, Privacy Hub only monitors webcams and microphones. Functionality for other USB devices will be added in the future.***

# How to Use
## Selecting Devices
To select the devices you want to monitor, click on the "Select Devices" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

Afterwards, you can choose the devices on the Select Devices screen.

## Monitoring With the Devices & Processes Screens
Privacy Hub has two main views.
1. The Devices screen, which displays processes grouped by the devices that they are using:

2. The Processes screen, which reverses the grouping:

Both of these screens let you monitor what processes are using your selected devices. If a process is accessing your device in any way, it will display on these screens. This does not mean the processes are actively using them -- it simply means that they currently have access to them. 

### Refreshing
The screens automatically refresh every so often, but you can manually refresh them with the "Refresh" button, if you desire.

## Trusted Processes
If there is a process that you don't want notifications for, you can add it to your Trusted Processes list.

Any processes that currently appear on the Devices and Processes screens will appear here. Select the processes you want to trust, and then click "Confirm Selection." Trusted processes will not trigger notifications when they start using your device, but they will still appear on the Devices and Processes screens.
