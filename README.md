# Privacy Hub - Capstone Spring 2021 Project
Privacy Hub is a Windows app that lets you track which of your computer's processes are currently using your USB peripherals, such as a webcam or a microphone. You can specify what USB devices to keep track of. You can also set trusted processes so you are not notified of their device usage.
